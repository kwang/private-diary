# 📘 Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Name: **Daylink – Audio/Video Diary App**

---

## 🧫 Overview

**Objective**:
Build an iOS application that allows users to record personal diaries via **text**, **audio**, or **video**, and save entries directly to the native **Notes app**. Users can set **reminders** that link back to Daylink to prompt journaling behavior.

---

## 🎯 Goals

* Enable users to **create and store diary entries** in various formats (text/audio/video).
* Seamlessly **save diary entries to the Notes app** with appropriate metadata.
* Offer a **reminder system** that links directly to the app for quick entry.
* Maintain a **minimal, intuitive UX** to support emotional expression and routine journaling.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Target Users

* iOS users aged 15+, especially those interested in wellness, journaling, and habit tracking.
* Users who prefer privacy and simplicity (no cloud backend, uses Notes app storage).
* Creatives and professionals who reflect via voice/video notes.

---

## 🧹 Features

### 1. **Home Screen**

* "Start Entry" button with options:

  * ✍️ Text
  * 🎧 Audio
  * 🎥 Video
* Display recent entries (links to Notes app, read-only)

---

### 2. **Diary Entry Modes**

#### a. **Text Mode**

* Rich text editor (basic formatting)
* Auto-title based on timestamp (editable)
* “Save to Notes” on completion

#### b. **Audio Mode**

* Record audio (AVFoundation)
* Playback before saving
* Optional transcription (future version)
* Saves both audio and text summary to Notes

#### c. **Video Mode**

* Record via front/back camera
* Preview and re-record option
* Saves video to Notes as file attachment + timestamp/description

---

### 3. **Reminder System**

* User sets **daily/weekly custom reminders**
* Reminders use **UNNotification** framework
* Notification opens Daylink directly via deep link
* Optional smart suggestions (e.g., “Haven’t written in 3 days”)

---

### 4. **Notes App Integration**

* Use `EventKit` or `NoteKit` (private APIs require workaround or share sheet)
* Diary entries saved to a dedicated **“Daylink Diary” folder in Notes**

  * Title: `Diary - [Date/Time]`
  * Metadata: mood (optional), entry type (text/audio/video)
  * Attachment: text, audio or video file

> *If direct Notes API is not viable due to Apple sandboxing, fallback via `UIActivityViewController` share sheet to prefill Notes.*

---

### 5. **Settings**

* Default entry type (text/audio/video)
* Reminder frequency (daily, custom time)
* Auto-save to Notes toggle
* Dark mode support

---

### 6. **Onboarding Flow**

* Brief intro (1–2 screens)
* Ask for permissions:

  * Microphone
  * Camera
  * Notifications
  * Access to Notes (via share sheet or Files)

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Security
